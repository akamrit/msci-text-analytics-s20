My daughter wanted this book and the price on Amazon was the best.
She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.
I was hoping there were more where those came from.
This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however.
There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops.
There is a "Fresh and Fruity" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled "I Scream for Quick Pops!", "Bake Shop", and  "Coco Loco".
As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on "Tips" and "Techniques" are useful.
There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual.
The pages about core pops are especially helpful, as they include recipes for pink, purple, and orange outer layers for brightly-colored core pops.
Many, including the recipe for a vanilla base, call for vanilla pudding, where vanilla Greek yogurt would do just as well.
On the bright side, many of these recipes may appeal to children, whereas most pop books that I have seen are geared more to adults.
There are flavors like "Cookie Dough", "That's a S'more", chocolate peanut butter, and peanut butter and jelly.
Most of the fruit recipes are gimmicky and contain too many ingredients.
The recipe for Lemonade pops contains orange juice, which is fine, but the addition of vanilla extract kills the fresh fruit flavor.
The recipe for mango pops includes orange, apple, banana and lemon, which are too many competing flavors.
Mango and orange together make a terrific pop.
The book is great for chocolate lovers and those looking for dessert pop recipes.
For fruit pop recipes, "Top Pops" by Emily Zaiden is far better.
This book is a must have if you get a Zoku (which I also highly recommend).
There is a large variety of recipes from simple, to fancy.
The flavor combos are creative, and it gives you ideas for decorating the pops too.
They turn out as beautiful as they are tasty.
After reading it you will be inspired to create your own recipes too.
I have really enjoyed reviewing all of the recipes.
Sure - some are more difficult than others, but there is a nice variety in this book.
For me it was totally worth it just to get the quick shell recipes alone.
We have only tried the chocolate so far, but it is so tasty.
Also, it has great instructions for tips on using the Zoku.
This book is so beautifully illustrated and easy to follow.
It helps you to understand the Zoku better.
It might have been even better if they made the recipe units for different sized molds.
These recipes produce too much for a single mold unit.
It would have been nice if they used a matrix for the ingredients like on a box of rice.
I am just math lazy and bought a single mold Zoku.
Dividing 3/4 of a cup, 3 tablespoons or 3 1/2 tablespoons is kind of dicey in my kitchen.
The Zoku accessories are pricey, but the recipes have the exact amount you need to make the pops.
I have made it through 15 varieties so far, and I like them all.
Clear and helpful information, and then some superb recipe suggestions clearly outlined.
The recipes in this books are tedious to make.
I found that easier and simpler recipes can be found online.
I had no problem with the recipes online working in the Zoku maker.
This beautifully illustrated book featuring ten colorful,glittery butterflies is a favorite at our house.
I got this as a gift for my niece and she loved it.
It's a super cute book and ill be getting it for any other nieces that may come along.
This is the story of a group of butterflies looking for a place to sleep.
The colors and the butterflies, and the cute story all were a hit.
A brilliant bedtime story with vibrant colors and gorgeous illustrations.
Each page teaches a different color and the illustrations boldly burst with that color.
, is how the book starts off and we are then led all around this color dreamland.
The butterflies in the book are popped out and sparkly.
As we turn each page the color butterfly we are reading about disappears.
Each page mentions the color twice and an animal.
The last page reunites all the butterflies and the colorful animals as we say goodnight...My daughter loved this book since she was 4 months old.
The colorful illustrations keep her interested and she likes to grab at the popped up butterflies.
A delightful story I enjoy reading again and again.
My daughter 1 year old really likes this book.
I bought it because of its similarity to the 10 little ladybugs book.
It has the same sort of colorful illustrations and I like it better as the ladybugs are not as pretty as the sparkly butterflies.
I would say it was one of her very favorites when she was young.
For a novice cake decorator who got talked into making her son's wedding cake, Wilton makes lovely cake decorating accessories to help with every step.
For a first wedding cake, it was amazing with Wilton's help!  This book is a must have for newbies like me.
I should not have bought it because it comes free from my cake decorating class.
Oh well, at least I gave the other copy to my sister.
i added an image of a cake i made according to this book lessons, which i advice anyone who is interested; to get this book.
excellent book, shipped on time, packaged nicely, helpful tips in the book, good price.
Very good experience, very happy with the product and vendor.
don't use it much but when i had it's been useful.
I recommend it to all who wants to learn how to decorate cakes.
Good book for beginners who need step by step instructions and guidance.
Got this for my girlfriend who runs a baking business and she said it was handy to have for a reference book.
She said it is handy to have when thinking of decorating ideas.
I'm hoping that I can learn how to make gum paste flowers to perfection for my daughters wedding, and maybe a few other cakes.
This 128 page book contains pictures and patterns for 38 tiered cakes.
It gives you instructions on how to assemble cakes on stands, pillars or stacked construction.
It also contains recipes for basic scratch cakes in white, yellow, chocolate, strawberry, and banana.
It also has the recipes for standard Wilton Icings, fillings, glazes, fondant (not the tasty marshmallow kind), color flow, gum paste, and candy clay.
There are tips for baking, leveling, torting, filling and icing the cakes.
It also gives some instruction on how to cover a cake with fondant.
There are suggestions for transporting tiered cakes, calculating servings per cake and cutting guides.
The book also includes patterns and instructions for various decorations.
As with all Wilton books, the last few pages detail products you can buy from them to duplicate all the designs in the book.
The problem is that some of these items don't seem to be available on their web site any more.
Still, it's a great idea book and I'm sure you can find acceptable substitutes for a lot of the items.
The first class is a demonstration by the instructor on how to put together a tiered cake.
The second class is where we bring in our own cakes and learn how to stack or pillar them.
It's a great way to top off the other four classes.
I am very happy I purchased this book as it containes so much great information and time saving tips.
This book isn't much help if you are not taking the wilton cake decorating classes.
you can get the basics but its really just a visual for the class!.
I have always wanted to learn how to decorate a beautiful cake, and I purchased this guidebook along with The Wilton Pastry bag kit.
I do, however, agree that this book did appear to be an advertisment for thier products, but the guide was helpful nonetheless.
This lesson plan is perfect for a beginner and definitely helped introduce working with fondant in a user-friendly way.
Each and every little hint that helps you to make your flowers appear real is in this book! You cannot go wrong with this book.
You will find yourself reading it over and over, makign flowers over and over.
You will see that your self-esteem will roar! People, co-workers, family members, friends will be dazzled and amazed -- and so will YOU.
It cannot be purchased from Wilton (which is a real crying shame).
I think Wilton is afraid that if they sell the book, they will miss out of selling classes, but not so.
Having bakes/cooked since the age of 9, I really didn't feel it was necessary but boy was I surprised.
I learned more in my first class than I had in years of teaching.
Wilton honestly needs to sell these lesson plans.
Not only will receive money from the classes, but they will also make money from the books.
Why would a company prefer their customers buy their books from someone else??? I've not figured that out.
Getting back to this lesson book...you will be extremely, extremely happy.
Your income will increase for making beautiful live-appearing flowers that you sell on your cakes.
Please try it...you cannot fail!!! Best book ever on making and decorating flowers!!.
This dvd is a must for any cake decorator.
It is presented in short and easy to understand segments.
It works great for the beginner or as a quick refresher.
The instructor did an outstanding job of both explaining and demostrating?.
I loved the book, very complete, detailed, clear instructions and easy to learn procedures.
It is a comprehensive guide, useful for success in the art of pastry.
This has certainly improved my cake decorating knowledge as a pure novice.
I will now purchase the other books so I can learn more.
Even this is the 2nd course, it is easy to follow.
I don't sell cakes but make them for friends and family.
This is only a hobby so I don't make cakes everyday.
I can pick this book up and follow the directions and get great results.
I recommend this book most highly with its inspiring and easy-to-follow instructions.
My local craft shop did not offer the fondant course when I wanted to take it so I decided to teach myself.
I followed the lessons in the book and my fondant cakes have improved greatly.
I would definitely recommend not only buying this book, but seeing how much you can teach yourself before spending the money on the class.
Shows several types of simple, easy to perform techniques.
I would recommend this item to anyone! Works great for baking! I would buy again.
I got this for my daughter in law.
Is shows how to use all the tools in the kit.
I bought this book to help me out with decorating cakes and cupcakes as a beginner.
I have found this book to be an excellent reference for the first time decorator.
I ended up buying two different tips that did not come with my cake decorating set, that I have found very useful.
I bought the cake curved spatulas, from Amazon,that work very well.
I also bought the bench knife, and found a 16" cake lifter, and a 18" cake leveler.
I got all these great ideas from this book.
I bought other things in the book from Amazon, however, the list goes on too long to keep mentioning everything.
My youngest daughter requested this as a gift.
She was very happy with it and I may buy another one for my middle daughter.
I saw this book at Target and flipped through it.
Cake decorating has always been a hoby for me.
This book is excellent for us self taught decorators.
It is a basic book for beginners and it is easy to understand.
It has a lot of ideas and I recommend it.
The Book is very easy to read and follow it breaks down working with fondant and Gum Paste very Simple.
I loved all the information I found in this book, very good ideas and pictures I recommend it to new beginners.
I am thoroughly enjoying being able to learn at my own pace.
Also, not ordering next book until I finish each book.
Very motivating and thoroughly entertaining to all who are subjected to guessing what I actually made.
I love Wilton books they are always so attractive and enjoyable to browse through.
Still I have learned so much about cake decorating from them.
GREAT FOR BEGINING!! has all the things you need there are very few things i dont use from this kit !! would recommend!.
This is more of a packing review than a review of product.
The book does what it's intended to do.
It came in 24 hours so I was grateful for that.
This book is great for beginner fondant makers.
I was able to follow the instructions and tips and they helped a lot.
i learned how to make butter cream roses out of this book, very nice step by step instructions, easy to follow.
This book is amazing! I love how Wilton publishes books for every stage of baking! This book is a must have for beginers!.
I was a little disappointed in this book when I first got it.
There is a helpful section called "The Perfect Cupcakes; How to bake, ice and decorate", and there are about six pages of recipes.
Just don't expect anything sophisticated looking in it OR that many silly-feet ideas.
Maybe this one was an earlier print, but my classmates and instructor's course booklets were a few pages different.No biggie though.
This lesson plan is a great companion to the Wilton decorating classes.
I would consider myself an intermediate level decorator, and very good at self-study on many topics.
This book was recommended by my cake decorating instructor.
If you want to get started on cake decorating this is the book for you!.
I have never been a good cake decorator.
It has always been just out of reach.
This book made me say &#34;duh&#34; in my head so many times it's embarrassing.
It really breaks it down and simplifies some of the basic techniques for noobies (like myself).
Lots of interesting and helpful information for a beginner.
My daughter loves to bake and this will give her a opportunity to create much more.
Easy to follow even for a clutz like me! Very informative and the instructions are straight forward.
Im new to cake decorating so I have really enjoyed this book.
There is step by step instructions for different designs and ideas and lots of hints and tricks for working with fondant and gumpaste.
Bought this book when I was hyped up and excited about baking and decorating cakes.
Although the designs are very outdated, it is very informative and I enjoy taking it out to view on occasion.
She said it has good instructions and pictures and was helpful.
I recently purchased Colette's Cakes which is also wonderful, but so much of it is advanced, and I'm just not there.
This book sticks to basics which, for me, is essential to focus.
If I see to much detail I tend to become frustrated and over anxious.
The paper is a bit thin and will need some support or will probably not hold up very well.
Nothing a little clear contact paper can't cure though, so no big deal.
I've always loved cake decorating, ever since I took my first Wilton class.
Gum Paste and Fondant seemed beyond my capabilities but when I saw this book I decided to give it a try.
The book is very easy to follow with lots of step by step pictures.
It's a lot of fun but, I admit, a bit frustrating.
No matter how closely I follow the steps, my creations never turn out exactly like the pictures.
I think part of the problem is that I'm a perfectionist at heart but....grrrr.....I can't fault the book, as all Wilton Lesson Plans, it's great.
THIS WAS EYE CATCHING AND WHEN I ORDERED IT I KNEW I HAD TO HAVE IT.
I learned a few tricks from this book.
I am new to baking nice looking stuff.
This helped me become a better decorator and got courses 2,3 and 4 as well.
Took class years ago, using this as a refresher before starting a cake.
Sometimes a video is faster than a book.
What a great book to help you get started on learning to decorate cakes.
I am trying my best to get into FONDANT and THIS book has motivated me to try harder and harder.
This short-but-sweet (ha) book gives all the basic information you need to get started with cake decorating.
It shows how to make a number of shapes with the icing, an icing recipe, and has lots of helpful illustrations.
If you can learn from just looking at a page on a book with a few written details, it will teach you without expensive classes.
But if you are using in addition to the class, all good too.
Keep it handy to look back at once in a while as a resource.
The book is full of color pictures so very well illustrated and the directions are clear and easy to follow.
I also bought the class kit to go with it and it works great.
would recommend for people wanting to learn how to do this on their own at home without a class.
I needed this for my third Wilton's class, and it was cheaper on Amazon.com than in the store.
It's part of the curriculum, so it's required.
Whether it is good for skill development or not, I take my classes very seriously, and get alot out of them.
I also believe in checking prices everywhere for the class supplies.
Amazon was cheapest, and I received it in 2 days, free shipping, Amazon prime.
I really like all the helpful information in this book.
It even has a recipe to make your own buttercream icing.
I'm glad I purchased this item on amazon.com.
This is a small simple book but tons of basic information on baking.
I really loved the graphs regarding the piping tips - I have so many of them but never knew what exactly do they do.
So that was really nice to figure out everything on the chart with the pipe tip number!.
I do have some background in cake design, but this really helped me take it all to the next level.
I still need lots of practice with flowers so this is perfect for me.
I would have liked a few more tips and a bit more direction, but on the whole it was worth the money.
I use to cake decorate as a kid in 4H, this book was a great refresher.
Helps me make gorgeous cupcakes for friends and family.
This book shows you how to decorate different items.
It explains the in's and outs of doing it.
THis book has been real helpful to my daughter.
She is just starting out and has made some really good flowers with this book.
The product was very easy to use and it will have you making some beautiful decorations of flowers and other decorations.
I highly recommend this seller for their speedy and excellent product.
I purchased this book without taking the course.
Cake decorating classes in my area are almost nonexistent so I have to be self taught.
Lots of pictures and detailed instructions will guide you through the beginning of cake decorating.
I have almost every Wilton Yearbook since 1977.
I still use them and review the back issues frequently for ideas.
I do do not like the newer issues as much because I do not care for fondant, so I love the older books.
On the whole, I like this book very much.
Sure enough, it made it easier to do everything, there was less hardening and bumps, and everything looked prettier.
great book, so many fun ideas..can't wait to get startedgreat product, fast shipping.I love the Wilton books and will keep buying them.
with four kids I'm really getting into doing their own cakes for their birthdays.
Learned alot and looking forward to creating the wonderful creations they show on the book.
I'm a Star Wars fan and I bought this with the intention of using it for groceries but it turned into my new diaper bag.
It's huge! I can fit everything i need in it where before I had my diaper bag and another bag and my purse.
It has started to come apart on the side but I can sew it or order a new one it's so cheap.
I got this for my bf and he loves it.
The stitches on the sides failed so I had to re-stitch it.
That held well but then the plastic lining on the sides ripped.
My bf used it daily for several months before I had to replace it.
Overall a good product but wish it was better made.
This makes a great reusuable gift bag for the Star Wars Fan.
Well made and fun design for fans of the original movie.
The art work is nice and the print is very clear.
It is easy to use & works very well.
I like the auto turn off so you dont run your battery out.
The only drawback is that the buttons are very small.
I would love to have the same product with bigger buttons.
it replaced a franklin spelling corrector i had  since 1989.i don't like the plastic case.
i broke a fingernail trying to open it.i purchased the new corrector because the characters were more readable than the older model's characters.
It has ten thousand words in it's data base.
It's quick to check things and it also stores all her friends' phone numbers, etc.
Fun and easy to use, there are more and more of them appearing in the classroom now.
Works well but wish the display was just a bit larger.
For the money it does what I want and I would buy it again.
I used to date this girl who loved Scrabble.
So, by association, I had to as well!  We used to play a lot - even with her Grandmother.
I thought this was a dumb way to play Scrabble, at first, but then I came to love it.
If you're all "cheating", then it becomes a different game - the strategy changes.
Too bad I had to dump her for being utterly insane! (I'm sure she was bipolar-scitzophrenic or some variant thereof).
I kept the Franklin Spelling Corrector!  Still have it to this day!.
Demo must be cleared every time you turn it on.
Slow if input is incorrect & may require a crazy input to get proper spelling.
This one seems to be made better than my Seiko spell check.
I like the cover on it as well.
If you are a crossword addict you need this product.
It works for my daughter, accurately finding words that she has no clue how to spell (e.g., "becuz" immediately found "because").
The one that arrived was black; she and I would have preferred the blue that was pictured.
I love to do crossword puzzles and this is a fun product to help me find or figure out those impossible clues.
Yeah I know you can cheat and check out online answers but I prefer to challenge my grey matter.
I had one of these for years before it finally died (even with replacing battery it stopped working properly/easily).
This was perfect for propping up textbooks so that I could take notes.
This book stand is highly adjustable and functional.
It works great for most moderately sized hardcovers and paperbacks.
For overtly thick professional books you may have to consider The Easi-Reader Bookstand which is much studier.
Holds my law books up perfectly! The stand Also allows you to turn the pages for easy reading and use.
Had my doubts that this would hold a 300 page paper back book because it's kinda thick and therefore stiff.
SIMPLE  BIG BOOK or small book it holds them all and the design allows for easy page turning.
I am using it to take notes for study.
Bought a much bigger holder at twice the expense and returned it.
This is a very versatile book stand that is easy to carry around and easy to store.
It is ideal for smaller books and for those readers who don't need variety of reading angles.
However, it can accommodate larger books as long as you are a bit careful how you use it.
In addition to books, it works really well with a variety of electronic book readers and the new generation of tablet computers.
I've used it with myKindle Wireless Reading Device (6" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)and iPad.
The first holder that I bought broke after a few months of use.
It will hold your book where your want it to be.
It will save your neck and keep you hands free to take notes or whatever as you read.
I just keep it in my backpack at all times.
It handles my 1000 page law books, so no worries in that department.
I see other people clunking around those huge, expensive wood book stands.
I bought one for myself and everybody that sees it loves it.
It's very light and easy to carry around.
I like mine so much, I bought extra ones to give as Christmas present to my mom and other family members.
Holds even my Big study Bible well, and let me write my notes below it.
Great for Students.Looks too small to support a big book, but it does, and folds up light into my backpack.
I've used plate holders and even copy stands from the stationary store in the past, but this is the Real McCoy.
Quite steady when used with a medium to large size book.
For small softcover I would use something else though!.
I use this for everything from propping up cookbooks in the kitchen to reading hardcovers at my desk while eating my lunch.
Most recently I've been using it for my Kindle 2.
Works great for everything, but a little tricky for some paperbacks because they slip around a little bit.
It does work best with the average-sized hardcover (think novel- sized).
Folds up nice and fits well in a drawer or in the front pocket of my backpack.
Sturdy while not impeding the process of actually reading/viewing the book.
This mug is fantastic, it washes well, has a good weight, and can double as a nifty negotiation tool.
I've been eying this cup for awhile now and finally broke down and purchased it.
Great concept but finger holes seriosly too small.
I bought this for my boyfriend and he just loved it!It was really good quality for the money.Very cool mug.
The finger holes are a little small and hard to release the cup if you use all 4 holes.
Just use the top two  and the large hole with three fingers and it works great.
Was a little smaller then expected but over all good product, durable and very cute.
This is as described but for some reason, I was still expecting it to be a little larger.
I purchased it with the intention of using it when making my daughter's lunch - cutting cheese slices, sandwiches, cucumbers, etc.
It's the perfect size for what I wanted.
This cookie cutter is perfect for use with fondant and making impressions in buttercream icing to be traced over.
At first it seemed off, meaning it was lopsided when placed on the table, but I was able to straighten that out.
I received it super fast considering it came from across the country!  Overall, I'm pleased with the item and the seller.
It's a little small but  that's OK (keeps  one from overeating too many cookies.
Seems very solid and Ithink it will last.
Have not yet used it but the cookies are sure to be micro.
I really like these ice trays, because they for one have a cover and therefore prevents any freezer odors from getting in.
Also, they stack nicely on top of one another.
Another thing I like is the Purple color lids.
I would definitely recommend these to my friends.
I don't use many ice cubes, and they would evaporate form the tray before I used any.
When I first discovered this Tupperware ice cube tray, I was delighted.
The ice stays large even with a frost free refrigerator.
These are by far better and less messy.
They do work very well and a little water on the bottom pops them right out! A great product!.
These ice trays are awesome!  Highly recommend!!  Keeps ice contained and fresh!!!  Definitely worth purchasing even if they cost a little more than other brands.
I have used the same ones for over 10 years and they still aren't showing any signs of wear.
I purchased these to freeze baby puree and they work great.
With the covers, the puree will not be contaminated by other odors in the freezer.
The cubes come out easily too, just need a twist by holding both ends of the tray and they will loosen up.
I prefer these citrus peelers to using a knife to peel oranges and grapefruit.
It's safer and easier to pack in a lunchbox.
These disappear in my house the way socks do, so I'm glad to have a half dozen of them.
I like the handle length on these and the added bonas of not having to use my nails for the pith removal.
I have had the finger ring style, Already gave 2 away, Hope I don't loose them in DW.
Months later we are still using this inexpensive set of citrus peelers to help kids peel their oranges in our school lunchroom.
These are great - like we used to get at parties but different colors.
These are handy items so I was glad to find them.
They were a fun item for our Christmas stockings.
I needed just one more of these but this set was too good to pass up.
I like having more that one color too.
This allows me to score an orange before slicing off the rind to make perfect garnishes for mixed drinks.
if you have never used one of these to peel an orange or any citrus you do not know what you are missing.
they last for ever and work every time.
I always seem to lose my orange peeler.
Good product but when all colors are shown, that is what I thought I was buying.
These do what I expect them to do, which is to provide an excellent seal and be durable.
A little pricey but can't argue for the quality.
They are useful for storing small objects such as buttons, beads, scrapbooking items, paperclips, and similar items.
At Tupperware parties, the Hostess recommends running the lids under hot water to loosen them up so they fit easily.
If you do this, then they work well for carrying aspirin or vitamins.
I had looked high and low for a 1 ounce souffle cup and lid set for our lunchboxes.
The only ones I could find were disposable, and I strive to make our lunches completely trash free.
Most containers aren't big enough to hold them.
These are perfect.* They have plenty of room - I don't have to methodically arrange my vitamins to allow the lid to close.
I estimate these will hold around 20 big vitamins.
9/9/11 Update: I just attached an image showing this with 16 vitamins.
I think it would hold 20 if you work at it.
The bonus is that a snug lid means I don't worry about them opening and spilling my vitamins.
Nice!My daughter loves these in her purse, too.The uses are practically endless (aspirin, gum, paper clips, skittles :)HIGHLY Recommended!.
With this container they can get them any time and I don't have to worry about them dropping the glass jar.
It's great to carry on picnics or to the lake.
very convenient, draining feature is great & goodcapacity.
if only it wasn't colored so you could see the contents a little better & know what wasin there.
i have a bunch of these in my fridge, & it's always trial and error findng the olives, pickles, sundried tomatoes  artichokes.
i get there in the end, but if you could see the contents better, cooking would be faster!.
It holds jalepeno peppers and make it easy to access them - 'cause the jars are not user friendly!.
Works great for storing anything you need to keep submerged in liquid in the fridge.
I typically use mine to store celery in water.
we make pickled eggs, also known here as red beet eggs.
The square shape makes it fit neatly in the back corner of my fridge.
The lid fits well; the strainer is sturdy.
I've had mine for five to ten years, and it is still good as new.
She had her red beets eggs in a jar, which cracked spilling red juice all over the bottom of her firidge.
I have used mine to store asparagus with the ends in water to keep it fresh.
I think this would also work to marinate a few pieces of chicken.
I also know someone who uses hers, without the strainer, to store brown sugar.
This container is larger than the one that I had previously.
It will hold a 1/2 gallon of home made pickles with the liquid easily.
Keeps them fresh and makes it easy to get your pickles out instead of having to leave them in the jar they were canned in.
Great set to start with or to fill in the gaps.
No frill, and no damage after months of use.
I like the three pronged forks; it's fun and different.
These are good because they are inexpensive, but they are not the most aesthetically pleasing and are very light weight.
we have the bowls, cups, and plates from ikea and love them all.
They are a great quality, perfect size, and the thicker weight of the plastic makes them feel just right when holding them.
The lip/edge is curved enough so it doesn't feel sharp.
They also have a pretty wide base, which I imagine helps them tip over less.
My 2 year old does good with them, and I like to drink juice out of them as well.
These don't quite make the dimension, and are a bit smaller than I was hoping for.
However, I love the colors, and haven't had a problem with spilling yet.
This is the double set, so you get two of each color for a total of 12 cups.
They are not very translucent, if that matters.
These are great to bring up to the pool since they are plastic.
They are small, but perfect size for a glass of red wine or any drink.
They are definitely &#34;kid cups&#34; but suitable for adult drinks as well.
(ages 2-8)  Bigger kids are okay, but they really work size wise for the young kids.
I was doubtful about getting two sets of these, but I am glad I did.
They don't hold all that much fluid so if there is a spill...and there is ALWAYS a spill...it isn't so bad.
I put them in the dishwasher on the top shelf.
We've had a couple left in weird places that ended up holding science experiments but they washed up just fine.
they are the perfect size for kids to they don't get to much of whatever they are drinking.
They wash nicely in the dishwasher, and the colors are vibrant.
You get 12 small tumblers in this order, they are just as they appear in the picture.
They are sturdy, IKEA quality, they will last years.
I like the matte texture that acts as a grip agent on the bottom half of each cup.
They are not BIG cups, but that is actually perfect for my students.
With grandchildren, this is the perfect combination of colorful and functional.
I bought two sets and had my daughter take one home for their use at home.
We bought these before and have lost them over the last year or so.
I reordered because I trust these cups.Easy wash, comes out of the dishwasher without being tweaked by the heat.
Good size for children's hands under age 8 and holds enough to satisfy a child's thirst.
The ribbed bottom helps prevent slipping through little fingers too.Overall, really like this product!.
I was looking for tumblers to replace the use of paper cups in the bathroom.
Unfortunately, these were a bit too small for what I had intended.
They appear to be well made and were helpful when I had visitors with little kids.
with 6 grandchildren, these are perfect and easy to find in the grass:)  They are sturdy and just the right size for little hands.
We assigned each family member a color, and purchased 3 sets.
They are wonderful, and they don't tip over due to the proper design of the weight distribution of the liquid.
For any person over 6, you need to drink 2 cups of water to feel like you had one cup.
The metal is a little more thin than I imagined but it is cute.
Easily bendable, it can become hard to close, but it can be bent back into position.
Got this for my daughter for Christmas (2 year old) and she loves it.
She's at the age where putting things in to boxes and taking them out can occupy her for some time.
She loves putting little treasures in here and taking them all over the place.
The size of the box is like that of a metal lunch box.
We haven't had any problems with it and it is quite durable for a play date.
I like it, but the material it was made can bend easily.
My son love it it match with his collection.
My son is a huge Curious George fan and one of his favorite stories is the one where Curious George Rides a Bike.
So, it couldn't be a better lunch box for him.
My grandson loves Curious George and he like to carry things like this around.
I think he will love and and put some of his animals and other things in it.
I got this so I am able to carry snacks on the weekends.
We are never home so when I saw this I had to get this.
First our toddler loves curious George and second it was just darling.
Best part so easy to clean with just a wipe.
It's perfect in size not too big or small.
Kids are really into Curious George so they love this tin box to keep all their &#34;stuff&#34; inside.
I already have one of these I had purchased a year ago on Amazon, and, I absolutely love it.
It does a great job chopping onions, pecans, tomatoes, cilantro, etc.
I ordered this one for my daughter, and, she loves it.
I use this mini a lot more than I use my food processor.
The size works great, especially when baking!  I highly recommend!.
Was a little skeptical of how this would hold up.
It gets much more use than the larger cuisinart.
Besides myself being a Cuisinart snob, I will say that I wouldn't use any other product in my kitchen.
This does a wonderful job on small jobs such as pestos, or making peanut butter.
This one chops very good specially garlics, onions, etc.
As usual Amazon did it's thing and got this mini chopper out to us in a jiffy.
Yep, it do a mighty fine job and with very little effort! Sliced 1" thick and quartered a nice size purple union.
Zap, zap, zap with the neat lever and wa-la, fine chopped union with no juice.
Took three sweet pickles and zap, zap, zap again and got finely chopped pickles with no juice, ya-hooo.
Hummmm, gotta get out tha Gum-mbo pot now.
Get to tha store and get some assorted goodies.
Hey, it's File Gumbo time and I'm gonna be "King of tha Kitchen" again.
Now ladies, sorry! Your he-man is gonna lay claim to this here "power tool" "toy" for himself, lol.
Yes, and it's a dandy looking little thing too.
Long life, who knows, but today it's a gooood life! It do seem to be sturdy and solid enough for a long life.
Bought this for my Mother who had her version from about 8-9 years ago finally die out.
This purchase was a replacement for the one the kids broke trying to operate it.
I liked it enough to purchase it twice.
I also own a large food processor (also a Cuisinart) that I use for substantial tasks like making bread dough, slicing vegetables, etc.
It has performed very well at all of these tasks and years later, still has lots of power and cleans up beautifully.
It is fantastic and I could not say enough wonderful things about it.That said, I do have a couple of caveats.
The first is that I would never buy it as a primary food processor.
It is just too small for normal tasks.
Even when I am making something in a small quantity like a dip I typically find it is too much size-wise for this processor.
Using it in an application like this would take forever.
However, it's great for doing basic chopping tasks because it is so easy and light to pull out onto the counter and efficient.
I also love how the stainless steel look coordinates with my appliances and other gadgets.
Overall it is a great product and if it ever dies I am likely to replace it with another Cuisinart.
Bought this to replace an old Mini Cuisinart Processor that was worn out (it was about 12 years old).
Love the red color, matches my toaster and coffee pot.
Use it for small jobs instead of dragging out the big food processor.
I have to puree my veggies and fruits.
I am a fanatic about kitchen appliances, specifically Cuisinart.
Not only was I not disappointed, but this has become my most-used kitchen appliance.
I can mince garlic, make guacomole, turn garbanzos into hummus, and perform a host of other useful tasks.
It is perfect if you want to make something quick, and don't won't to drag out the heavier, full-sized food processors.
But, it's better to do smoothies in a blender anyways.
Got this over a year ago for my mom in law and it's still doing its job! :) Fantastic.Good for salsas, sauce and more.
He brought this home and well, I've been loving it ever since.
I do mostly use it for onions, but it is wonderful for spices and nuts too.
I don't like the way it cleans up, however, it can be a little much when you do onions.
You HAVE to put it in the dishwasher for sure if you do onions because the plastic definitely holds the odor.
Wish it was glass! Great machine for the money and I highly recommend it.
chops evenly and clean up is a breeze.
I've been using this almost daily for about a month.
Easy to use, easy to clean, and looks nice on the counter.
No real complaints, except that the bowl feels kind of thin, like it would crack easily.
I own a full-size Cuisinart food processor and another mini (a cheap-o brand) and the bowls on those feel much sturdier.
I hope I'm wrong about the bowl, but I guess only time will tell.
My only complaint at this point is that this little mini-prep does not have a feed tube.
Obviously I knew this when I purchased it, but hindsight is 20/20.
This mini-prep-processor is the second Cuisinart product I have bought from Amazon.
The first was a refurbished convection toaster oven.
The careful engineering and attractive, simple design of both products impress me.
Avoid Black & Decker in the kitchen is my conclusion.
Anyway...this Little Honey, that's what I call him, arrived the day before Thanksgiving.
Before that I'd only used the B/D to pulverize cat food twice a day.
The cats spit out meat or fish pieces they'd have to chew.
Waste of money, so they get instant grind instead.What good timing! I put that Little Honey right to work.
I get more use out of it than my large food processor down in the cupboards somewhere.
That is after the recommended 10 to 12 seconds, alternating between Lo and Hi speeds.
I needed a way to liquify single servings of food to provide nutrition through my mother's feeding tube.
She does not tolerate the commercial nutrition, but does well with her customary food.
I tried using a blender, but the end result was inconsistent for bolusing through a feeding tube even after adding additional liquid.
I read the reviews for this and other mini Cuisinarts and decided to try the "cheaper" one.
I am impressed with its performance, ease of use and compact size.
It is clearly worth the small price I paid.
I most like the ports in the top for slowly introducing liquids.
It is perfect for my intended use, and I can envision how to use it in cooking.
This little baby is a must for any kitchen, from making salad dressings and marinades to salsas.
Just big enough that I use it for most of my food processor chores; rarely do I need to take out the big processor.
Quality food processor which is just the right size for the small batches needed by a couple.
You don't need to process a large amount most of which would spoil before it was all used.
Works great for small jobs including powdering some spices.
I also flip the blade over and shred onions with it.
If you fill it up too full it will not work well.
It is also very easy to clean up.
We received this for free when we purchased our Cusinart convention toaster oven.
We've used it to make small amounts of pesto or garlic sauce.
We've also used it to grind up fresh bread to make bread crumbs.
Given it's size, we had to feed it one slice at a time, but that was fine since the recipe did not require a lot.
So for small items, it's does a good job.We have noticed an electric burning smell if it's turned on for too long.
It's annoying, but not too bothersome.We have a 20 year old full size Cuisinart Food Processor that's still going strong.
The motor is very strong, the blade very sharp.
If your typical job, like mine, is chopping small items in smaller quantities, this is perfect.
It takes up a lot less space on the counter, too.The unit comes in steel color and white.
Before you buy a food processor, consider what you typically process.
If you do coffee, smoothies, pesto, chopped herbs and nuts and salsa, this may just be enough, saving you dollars and space.
I was a bit leery about this model and hesitated given the price.
Pesto, bread crumbs (including a batch of WAY overbaked croutons that were rock hard), spices, coffee beans, graham cracker crust (for a very tiny pie).
This is a great size, easy to operate, beautiful look on the counter.
The warranty is the very odd number of 18 months, so you get the idea it's not supposed to be a workhorse.
But used as recommended, I'm sure mine will last "forever".
I had one of these which i burned the motor out on a few years ago.
Kept using the mini processor attachment on my blender ntil today.
Bought this same model in stainless at Big Lots for $29.
So glad to have this back in my kitchen once again.
I may never have to pull out my large 11 cup Cuisinart (1992) ever again.
I received this as a present and was convinced I wouldn't find a use for it.
Much to my surprise I love it!  It sets on the counter next to my DLC7-Pro.
It is a whiz for chopping a cup ful of nuts for a recipe, making quick bread crumbs for meatloaf, chopping herbs and making dressings.
The blade reverses for chopping or mixing so make sure to have the side up you want for the task at hand.
It is easy to use and a breeze to clean.
I just pop the soiled parts in the dishwasher and forget it.
I would not want to be a day with out this tiny wonder.
This does a good job of pureeing things for my mother and it takes up relatively little counter space.
I can rinse the parts quickly and easily after I've prepared one food and move directly on to the next course.
This is a MINI processor, and that's why I bought it...NOT to do the big jobs, I have the "big boy" to do that.
I do like the how handy it is to do the small jobs, so I don't have to use the big one.
I use it a lot to make home made dressing.
Clean up is easy and quick, as is the machine.
It will scar the bowl if you try to grind hard spices, etc.
I bought this item specifically for grinding spices and herbs for indian cooking.
It does a fairly decent job with the spices although you need to have at least 1/4 cup for it to work well.
As to the herbs perhaps I'm doing something wrong but it did not do as well.
The herbs that were above the blade stayed put and it took a lot of scraping the bowl to get them chopped up.
Bought this as a gift for my daughter in law.
She has used it a few times and loves it.
I have had this cuisinart for about 2 years now, and it is still going strong.
It is also perfect for grinding cookies for pie crusts.
And the size means you don't have to be using a large volume to get great results.
Recommended by my sister and now I can too.
I use this all the time to chop up nuts, grate hard cheeses, and make small batches of hot sauces.
Works well when you don't want to pull the full sized food processor out and assemble it and then clean it afterward.
It'll chop a good sized onion up to start a pasta sauce, or a couple of hot peppers for a finishing to a stir fry.
Very handy and pretty well built even for couple time per week usage year after year.
I replaced my original mini-prep with this item after the plastic housing on the steel knife split.
The first one lasted about ten years, and I used it quite often, tho it was not abused.
I lost my old one when I moved, and I tried a few different types, but I was never happy.
I use it pretty much every day and it never fails me.
I had a smaller chopper of a different brand but wanted one that had a little larger bowl.
Great for chopping smaller amount of veggies and stuff.
Does what the big ones do only with smaller amounts.
I like that it does not have a long chute sticking up on the lid.
It pulses nicely and chops up garlic and onions quickly.
I also liked that it had 2 speeds and you could pulse.
I bought it for its small size to put in my camper, but liked it so much it has a place in the house.
I crush dry beans and dog kibble easily and fast.
Have no need to process large amounts at a time as it would not stay fresh.
This one works nicely, efficently and cleans up so easily.
Easy to use, clean and is versitile for wet foods and dry foods.
I would purchase it again for gifts if need to.
We have purchased many food processors over the years.
I saw this on a cooking show and immediately bought one.
Best small processor ever!!  Others do not pick up all of the pieces off the bottom of the processor.
This one picks up everything and creates a smooth blend of everything.
Buy one for yourself and pass them out to the kids as Christmas presents!.
I am a quadriplegic with very little hand dexterity and find cutting and chopping extremely difficult and time consuming.
A good friend gave me one of these as a gift in the 1980s.
I have processed things as soft as olives to as hard as almonds, and this machine tackles them all very nicely and clean-up in easy.
I bought this unit to replace one I had purchased in 1995 or 1996.
I ordered the new Black Chrome finish and it really is lovely.
It is made (and tells you so in the instructions) to be used continuously for no longer than one minute.
If you pulse it properly and don't just leave it running, it is fine.
This processor is the one I keep under the kitchen cabinet to be used to make small amounts of sauces,finely chop up garlic,chilies, etc.
I haven't had any problems with the old one because I did that very thing when it first arrived.
It is the perfect compliment to the larger processors and I would highly recommend it.
For such an inexpensive price I think it is worth it!.
A time for every seasoning......and a utensil for every purpose.
The Cuisinart Mini Prep does not serve well as a primary processor for heavy jobs.
That was not its intended design, or function.I obtained my first mini prep as a promotional gift with a DLC-7 purchase.
For many years they have been contributing to my cooking enjoyment as a problem-free, complimentary team in a busy kitchen.
I upgraded the old DLC-7 that is still mechanically perfect, with a MP-14 TM Limited Edition.The Mini Prep perfectly compliments larger processors.
It performs equally well making pesto, cr&egrave;med butter, chopped fresh herbs, including garlic, chopped nuts, small portion purees, deviled eggs, spreads, and speedy fresh salsas.
It has a fast and slow lever whose function I like because they may be "pulsed" on and off with an instantaneous response.
I especially love the function of the two (tiny) holes on the lid, along with the ease of the lid's removal for ingredient additions.
I have been using the Mini-Prep for a few years.
I like to use it for small jobs like chopping herbs, parmesan cheese, and for making pesto.
I haven't had any problems with processing parmesan cheese as one reviewer did.
In addition, the processor has two speeds, HI & LO.
I pulse at BLUNT/HI and then do continuous hold until its grated like I want it.
On occasion I find a stray piece that the blades missed but that's probably because I don't always cut the pieces as recommended.
Overall, I think this is a great little processor and well worth the price.
Just remember to read the instruction manual before you start using it.
I wore out my original one, so this purchase was a no-brainer.
I pulse/chop carrots for salads, and just this use is worth the price.
Carrots are so good for you, and I like small pieces of carrot in salads, not chunks like you get with a knife.
I use the mini processor for making small amounts of sauces, dressing, and grating single servings of firm cheese.
This one is just like my old one, except the black chrome is new to me and very nice looking.
This is definitely one of the handiest little gadgets in my kitchen.
It works well but is a little smaller than I had expected.
This is my fault and not the fault of the machine.
I bought this to grind mustard seeds when I found out I was obsessed with home made mustard.
It works great even when run for long periods (some mustard seeds must be processed for 6-8 minutes to reach proper grind).
It has plenty of power and has also now been put to use grinding romano cheese.
It's just a lot easier to use when I don't need the capacity of my 14 cup processor.
This happened after 4-5 years of regular use, though, it wasn't new by any stretch of the imagination.
In the end, though, I did just buy a new one.
This baby chops, dices, and is great for making emulsions for mayonnaise or Caesar salad dressing.
The blade can be flipped over for different uses.
If you read the directions that come with the product, they explain clearly how to use the appliance so that you don't get onion mush.
Otherwise, it does exactly what it says it does.
I love this little appliance for chopping small amounts of food.
It replaced one that I had used for 16 years.
Once I figured how to put it together, it worked just fine.
My first project was to grind chicken to make burgers.
I sliced the breasts into long pieces and laid them on the blades.
No sooner had I turned it on low when the job was done! I went through 3 breasts in less than 3 minutes.
Too bad some others did not have such good luck.
I was worried about the negative reviews but after using it myself I am convinced that those were user errors.
There is a possibility that the glass jar is not correctly placed on the base which could lead to accelerated wear of the plastic connectors.
This should not happen with a bit of care.
Only bit of criticism that I have is that the blender could be slightly faster and blend more foamy.
The glass is of excellent quality and very thick; I've banged it accidentally several times and there's not a scratch on it.
The top has a great grip when you close it.
The base is made of plastic and feels a little cheap.
I love my little blender!The color is the exact baby pink shown in pictures.
I mainly use mine to make my breakfast protein shakes in the morning and it blends up the fruit I put in like a champ.
In my humble opinion, most of blenders are not great.
The motors are not powerful to chop through heavy amounts ice and frozen fruit.
I've burned through a couple of cheap Hamilton Beach ones.
So if you are doing a lot of entertaining, you might want to look at a commercial one.Use your head.
You may need to pulse it a few time to shave the frozen stuff down.
Or you can slowly add ice after you blended the other igredients.
Also, you should look at the recipe book.
I have heard some of the high end Warings fit the bill.
I use this for my diet shakes and it's the best.
I also love that it is very easy to clean.
I'd lower my number of stars, but can't because this is an edit of a previous review.
I had this blender for four years (an admittedly long time, but I used it very rarely).
I noticed after a year or so that there were fine black plastic bits on the base of the blender.
So he went online and ordered the broken part for $[...].
When he tried to replace it we realized that an interior screw had become stripped and it was impossible to remove the broken piece.
THEN we threw it in the trash and bought an Osterizer, which doesn't have any plastic moving parts.
I chose this blender because I love the color pink.
It is a fair price for a blender that works well.
Those really didn't concern me since there were only a few of those.
The only thing that I would have wished for is a metal motor housing, instead of plastic.
I'll just have to be a little extra careful with it.
It's the sole reason I took off 1 star, but this is probably normal for modern, small appliances.
Unfortunately, almost nothing is made to last, any longer.
Planned obsolesence/replacement, so they can keep seling them, LOL.I'm more than pleased with my choice.
I love pink appliances and they are very hard to find.
This blender matches all my other pink appliances and is also a quality product.
I had a Cuisinart Duet before - which still works but it's not nearly as pretty as this pink one.
I'll have to use it more to see if it's really a great product.
This blender does a great job and is not to heavy or cumbersome.
It's easy to use and take apart for cleaning.
Not sure why all the bad reviews as we loved ours!  I am back to buy the 700 watt upgraded version of this blender.
It has lasted several years through almost daily smoothie making.
(Green smoothies are a family favorite!)I admit I never tried grinding up dry things or using it for many other purposes.
But for smoothies and mixed drinks it was perfect and durable!.
This is a great blender that's gotten a bad rap.
I've owned this model for years and it outperforms all others for my specific task: pureeing Progresso's Manhattan Clam Chowder.
The ice crushers don't liquefy the clam pieces.
Once it's throughly blended, like a shrimp bisque, it's a world class soup.
I'd put it up against anything in a top restaurant.
I've had one can a day for twenty years.
Unfortunately, this doesn't work for other Progresso soups (they're already too thick).
Another stroke of genius: blending pea soup with vegetable soup, but this only works for mid-price restaurant soups.
This is a high quality blender that is made to last.
I have had many blenders over the past decade and this is by far the best.
Whether it is smoothies, pancake batter, shakes etc....it does a great job.
Worked great for the three months that it functioned.
I liked the glass jar and it made great smoothies.
It is made in China and of apparently poor quality.
Too expensive to buy one every three months.
However, it still broke after three months so you should be careful.
BOUGHT THIS ONE AFTER A PLASTIC CONTAINER ONE BUSTED IN MID STREAM AND BLEW OUT ALL OVER MY NEW KITCHEN AND NEW WINDOWS TOO.
I was very hesitant to purchase this product this past christmas after reading the reviews here on Amazon.
My mother had wanted one for awhile, but always thought they were well over $100.
It has been used almost every day since Christmas 2003, and they have not had one problem.
My parents loved it so much they bought another one.
My parents did that, but I can certainly see a lot of people getting lazy and not cleaning it every time.
My mother bought this for myself and my husband for xmess about 4 years ago.
You don't want to use soap in a coffee maker ever.
We use a kitchen scrub brush to rinse all the grounds off under the tap and then DRY THOROUGHLY before putting it back together.
Not drying tends to cause the grounds to not transfer properly into the basket.Complaints:Honestly, 4 years wasn't enough time for me.
Eventually even our tricks to bypass the quirks stopped working and we threw it out.
The quality of the coffee is unsurpassed by any other machine (save my pump espresso machine) and we love our coffee around here.
FIVE stars for excellent coffee and ease of use.
I use the sink sprayer and have no trouble rinsing grounds out of coffeemaker.
I have bought two for my use in our two homes and given two as gifts.
Fresh ground coffee is the best!  If you are going to buy this grinder, be sure to buy the gold-toned metal filter.
After buying this I went and got a kuring k-cup which is much nicer.
I think everyone agrees it makes the best coffee for a coffeemaker in its price range.
I purchased a second one (amazon sale for $59.99)since it was cheaper than buying the individual replacement parts.
I use a soapy papertowel to wash the pieces and then throw it away.
just rinsing to rid the plastic of the coffee oils.
Assuming one has realistic expectations from such an inexpensive appliance, they will be very happy with this ice-cream maker.
Overall a great product.NOTE: For most of the recipes I've tried, this machine produces ice-cream of a consistency akin to soft serve.
Very tasty in any-case and things harden up nicely in the freezer if you have time to wait.
I received this as a wedding gift and like it a lot.
Although it is super easy to use, it is not really a practical gadget for regular use.
The canister requires a chunk of freezer space and must be frozen a day in advance.
The appliance itself has a small footprint and a nice cord keeper underneath.
Would be a good purchase for those who like different ice cream flavors, dieters, or those with special diet requirements (like no sugar).
I usually make mango ice cream in it.
In addition to ice-cream, it is fun for parties to make slushy fruity drinks.
In  that case you will want to get an extra canister.
Just saw this at Costco in Chicago for about 1/2 this price.
worth a trip to Costco if you have a membership.
I have had one of these for about 10 years.
How long this takes is dependent on how cold your freezer is inside.
I usually put mine in the night before I plan to use it.
It is easy to set up, use and clean.
It turns out a nice product - good enough to serve guests.
We like being able to have ice cream with less sugar and no chemicals.
My mom gave me this ice cream maker as a Christmas present a few years ago.
My husband and I are vegan, so we were really excited about creating new vegan ice cream recipes.
(I eventually started compiling them in my blog, A Vegan Ice Cream Paradise.)We've never had a problem with the machine.
Still, it's not too difficult, and the reward (awesome vegan ice cream) is worth it.
We actually found this product on clearance sale at JCPennys last winter.
It will also have a more crystallized and less creamy texture.
I still need to try the frozen yogurt.
With the price of good ice cream these days, this quickly paid for itself because it's much cheaper to make our own.
This product works great, if the unit kept in the freezer for long enough, the consistency of the ice cream gets very good.
I bought an ice cream maker so I could use organic ingredients, and everything has turned out fantastic so far.
We've been using this for almost two years with no problems and are pleased with the design.
I bought this ice cream maker last summer and ended up not using it much because of time constraints.
When i first got my ice cream maker, 3 days ago, I cleaned and put it in the freezer.
After pouring the ingredients in the top I let it go for 25 min.
It was a hard icecream on the softer side of the spectrum.
Still so good!I can't wait to try another flavor, frozen yogurt, and eventually premium(hard, I'm guessing).
This is THE BEST fool proof way of making ice cream.
This machine comes with a pretty thorough booklet with ice cream recipes in it but you can make "frozen ANYTHING" with this maker.
Make as little or as much as over a quart at a time.
First let me start by saying I was a little skeptical of ice cream makers.
The ones we had when we were kids required dry ice and lots of time, neither of which I have.
The ice cream is so good and really easy.
It makes the perfect amount for a family, not too much so you're sick of it before it's gone or too little.
Basically you just pour the ingredients in while it's mixing and in 30 minutes you have ice cream.
It is simple to use, and the results taste great!My only complaint is how loud the machine is.
I let my bowl freeze for at least two days before using it.
I try to stick to the lower fat recipes.
You can find endless recipes and ideas on the internet.
Yum!If you would like your own ice cream maker, you can't go wrong with this machine!.
I have had an old Donvier manual model for 30 years, so I'm used to using a chiller bowl.
However, there's no comparison between hand turning the paddle in the Donvier model and letting the Cuisinart do it's thing.
My ice cream is ready in about 12-13 minutes.
Love, love, love this Cuisinart.I debated on whether to get the 2 qt model or the 1 1/2.
I opted for the 1 1/2 qt and find that's plenty of ice cream.
As described, read all the reviews and decided to replace my leaking old Krupps with this one and do not regret the decision.
Next I will try the recipe for Nutella gelato or peach ice cream.
The grandkids love to help make and eat our creations.
I bought this product on the recommendation of my son to make cranberry ice for Thanksgiving.
I did everything that I expected it to do.
I'm the author of Lick It! Creamy Dreamy Vegan Ice Creams Your Mouth Will Love and this is the ice cream maker that I use.
It's easy to use, makes great ice cream, is fairly quiet.
I've had it for about 5 years and have made a LOT of ice cream with it and it's still going strong.
This is the same one as the 4qt.
ice cream maker that uses rock salt and ice, just larger.
(I know it's the same because the inlaws have the 4qt.
That's because I gave up with Rival after continued problems with my first two ice cream makers and ordered the Cuisinart from Amazon.
Is your icecream more of a milkshake than ice cream? I have some chef tips:1.Never put in chunky ingredients from the beginning.
They don't allow the butterfat to freeze correctly.
They need to be added at the end (chocolate chips, fruit, etc.)Soy milk? No problem.2.Never use imitation vanilla extract.
It contains propylene glycol which not only isn't as good as regular vanilla, it prevents milk and cream from freezing well.
If you add the ingredients first and then turn it on, the edges will freeze first to the bowl and your middle won't catch up.
The outside core is a very flimsy plastic.
This is so common that it says in the owner's manual that when it does this you need to stop it and move the ice.
This means you always need to be watching it during making.
Happens on both size models which is why I had to exchange this originally for the gel model at Wal-mart.
For some crazy reason, the paddle doesn't spin, the bowl does which means it makes the ice migrate and melt easily.
Rock salt should not go down your sink so we would also walk it outside to the street.
You don't want it in your yard either.
This means you ruin your mix and have to start over.
If you need more freezing time, you can just keep on going.
I love the Ben and Jerrys one because it's not just recipes, but goes into the science of making the perfect bowl too.
The Cuisinart has the nutritionals to every recipe, the Rival doesn't.
You probably don't want to see the calories of ice cream anyway.
Especially chocolate!WARRANTY:RE 1 yearRG 1 yearCA  3 yearsICE CREAM CONSISTENCY:RE: I was very disappointed in the Rival Electric.
It runs until it senses the outside edges are done but this left my inside ice cream edges not whipped.
Even on high butterfat ice cream recipes we had a perfect consistency so I fell in love with this one.
That was the main thing for me, to get a good whipped up ice cream.
Came without scratches, looks brand new! Look forward to using it soon.
Being diabetic I will be making my own sugar free ice cream and sorbet.
Decided to try the Cuisinart for a family party using our treasured family ice cream recipe.
Well, let me tell you -- we were all delighted.
Love the machine; am so glad I can make our family homemade ice cream again!.
We've had this Cuisinart ice cream maker for several months now and have made many different flavors of ice cream.
I've read some earlier reviews where the reviewer had a problem with the ice cream being too soft.
When it is initially finished it is not as hard as when purchased in a store.
However, merely by placing in the freezer, where ice cream belongs in the first place, it hardens to regular consistency.
I have one of these and just love to make homemade ice cream in it rather than my ice and salt ice cream maker.
I do have to say you really need to plan ahead as the bowl requires a long time to freeze.
That being said, I would buy this again.
Firstly, I have to admit that I've never made ice cream in it.
My favorite?  Fresh grapefruit juice with sugar, fresh mint, and lime juice.
You can also use it to make somewhat more &quot;adult&quot; fare.
The only down side to this machine is that once you start making your own stuff, it's neigh on to impossible to stop.
On the other hand, since you're making it yourself and can limit what ingredients you use, the end result can be enormously healthy.
Blend away as you would if you were making a smoothie.
It helps with chilling the mixture faster while it is being churned.
Mine did not melt nor drip into the mixture.5) Put an empty glass container in the freezer before you start making the ice-cream mixture.
Turn on the ice-cream machine and pour the mixture in.
Once the mixture thickens and has a soft-serve or thicker consistency, turn off the machine.
It is easy to use, very fast and cleans like a dream.
I also like the fact it does not make a huge amount I have to store somewhere.
This is a great product for small families.
I make Raw Cream Ice Cream twice a week.
I add 6 Raw Free-Range Egg Yokes, a 1/4 cup of Maple Syrup, 2 1/2 tablespoons of Vanilla Extract and 1 tablespoon of Psyllium Husks.
I consider it medicine for my 3 year boy.I find that it does stick to the bowl some.
It's not a problem unless you put it back in the freezer with ice cream in it.
I only do that when I'm leaving soon after making ice cream.
It's not totally quiet, but what do you expect from a motor.
It's quieter than the old salt and ice type.
I tried it to make sure it worked before I lost the gift receipt.
I made up a batch of ingredients to make vanilla frozen yogurt.
I poured the liquid in and off it went for 20-25 minutes.
It was louder then I anticipated, but nothing crazy.
I am looking forward to making more delicious ice creams, sorbets, sherbets, frozen yogurts, and even frozen slushy drinks.
It seems pretty darn solid and it easy to clean.
I bought this for me last summer, and I loved it so much, I bought another as a gift.
It's easy, taste so much better than anything you can buy, and it's fun to be creative.
Great way to use up ripe bananas, and make banana split ice cream.
I've made 3 batches with my machine; here are my observations.
That second batch came out very, very good; in the freezer, it ended up freezing quite hard but smooth &amp; consistent.
So, I tried to find a way to keep it softer.
Simply insert the paddle, pour in the mix, attach the top, and start it up.
Of course, you can always take a sturdy non-metal utensil to it to sample it right away.
You'll have to let the bowl thaw some before hand-washing.
Fresh ice cream has never been easier.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann.
I love my Cuisinart ICE-20 Ice cream maker and would highly recommend it to anyone.
I have made countless different recipes in it, and this machine makes creamy ice cream in mere minutes.
I have also partly frozen the ice cream and then layered a combination of flavors creating a stunning semifredo dessert.
An additional freezer bowl is on my Christmas wish list this year!.
I really found this product to be wonderful, compared to others which I have used.
so if it dies you can get contact amazon and get it replaced.
I really like this and I ordered it for my son and wife as I love mine.
No mess and you have great home made ice cream in about 30 minutes.
When/if my ever breaks, I would buy another one on amazon PRONTO.
I most often don't follow a recipe but simply create my own.
I don't think I ever threw out any of my creations and I am very picky and do throw out other non-frozen recipes.
I think my secret is to taste it before freezing it; if you don't like it the taste unfrozen, you won't like it frozen!.
This works well, but there are a few points to make it a success.-First, make sure your freezer is cold.
Recommended food storage is halved for every 5 degrees above zero F.
At -10 you are golden for this unit.-Second, make sure you freeze the bowl for a long time.
24 hours should be enough.-Third, make sure your ingredients are cold.
Even if they are cool, it should be ok, but will be softer.Custard based recipes work great.
I'm amazed how many people have become so accustomed to artificial flavors and conditioners, that "real" doesn't taste right anymore.
The old style salt and ice can maintain temps well, and the expensive integrated freezer units are about perfect, but obviously cost more.
You can't fault it for being something it's not though.The dasher doesn't scrape the side of the bowl, it sits off just slightly.
This leaves a ring of frozen icy cream, not a smooth ice cream stuck to the side.
I think the newer version has a better dasher/scraper.I might try running it in the freezer on an extension cord.
The ice-cream maker seems to work perfectly fine.
I have to say though, I am still working on getting perfect, creamy ice-cream from it while using quality ingredients.
I made my first batch of ice cream today.I made the vanilla which was very easy;vanilla,milk,sugar and cream.
i gave this to my boyfriend for christmas and he loves it.
i still think this is the easiest one you will find and it's a big plus to not need ice or salt.
very easy to clean and there is an opening at the top so you can watch it work.
:happy dance: I made real ice cream with this little machine.
Also this helps my ice cream not come out too runny.
I transfer it to a container and put it in the freezer and it "ripens" and becomes harder consistency.
I just use the basic vanilla ice cream recipe and for the maple nut I added one cup of maple syrup but used less sugar.
I added walnut bits at the end of the cycle.
Oh there is no timer on this unit so you have to decide when the cycle of it churning should end.
So far everything has come out delicious, I freeze it in a separate container for the "real ice cream" consistency.
This machine works perfect for the price, the amount of work, etc., you cannot go wrong.
I have used this beauty for dessert 4 or 5 nights a week since getting it over a month ago.
I mix up the ingredients and put them in the refrigerator to thoroughly cool, then put the freezer together and pour it in.
10 to 20 minutes later, it's ready (depends on exact mix).
Obviously you have to be aware of that.
just make sure that your freezer bowl is frozen solid.
leave it in your freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 days between ice cream batches just to be sure.
Also, you may want to chill your mixture for 1-2 hours in the refrigerator prior to using the ice cream machine.
My first batch was awful because my bowl was not completely frozen and my mixture wasn't as cold as it should have been.
Other than that, its an awesome machine that is easy to clean and makes wonderful ice cream.
If you really like ice cream or have a large family, you may want to buy an extra freezer bowl.
I've had this ice-cream maker for nearly two years now and love it.
What Donvier started, Cuisinart perfected! There are a lot of great features to this machine.
The extra bowl also helps if I'm in a hurry and don't want to totally chill the mix.
Then I chill it almost to the freezing point in one and move it to the second one.
The biggest problem I have noticed is that relatively few people know how cold their freezer is (as well as their fridge).
So easy and fast - as well as fresh good ingredients have made possessing this machine a delight.
The 2nd reason is inappropriate ingredients that prevent the cream from freezing.
Some of these ingredients are anything with alcohol, fresh citrus fruits (orange, lemon, grapefruit, etc) and kiwi - amongst some others.
Seems to me that anything that will prevent jello from 'setting' will also prevent ice cream from freezing properly.
If you want it firmer or harder, put it into a different container and put it back in the freezer.
Now get creative and enjoy the fruits of your labors :).
I wanted it so I could make more natural ice cream without all those additives.
I used a simple recipe from off the web: Some whole milk, condesed milk, and cocoa powder.
At first it was a failure because I only froze the container for 5 hours.
It didn't swish when I shook it, so I thought I was good to go.
After nearly 2 hours I just had cold ingrediants.
I put them in the fridge and froze the container overnight and restarted in the morning.
After only 30 minutes I had some of the most amazing ice cream I have ever had.
I will never buy ice cream from the store again.
This ice cream maker is awesome, I love it.
I can tell you that after 8 years or so of owning this type of machine I made ice cream 3 times.
It was messy, clean up was a pain and it was noisy.
After my machine was ruined by a leaky roof (divine intervention) I looked around and decided to purchase the cuisinart ice cream machine.
Since owning this maching I have made ice cream atleast once a week.
I have even made ice cream to go with dessert for a dinner for 75 people.
Some of the reviewers mentioned noise, they must have never heard the noise produced by tradtional ice cream machines that have a motor.
It is about the level of a food processor or blender.
I keep the bowl in my freezer and chill the ice cream and sorbet mixtures well before pouring them into the machine to begin churning.
I highly recommend buying an extra bowl if you need to make more than 1 1/2 quarts at a time.
With my "old fashioned" ice cream machine (salt and water), they always recommended ripening the ice cream and I continue to do so.
Best of all, I did not break the bank to get good results.
Although I love the end results on some of the pricer ice cream machines, my Dr.
Pepper pockets could not come up with the Champagne cost of those $100.00 or more icecream makers.
I am unsure were the $90.00 original sticker price came from.
At the cuisinart site you can purchase the same machine for $49.95 just like here at Amazon.
All you have to do is mix the ice cream base, pour it in the machine and flip the switch!.
It takes a little practice to get used to what works and what doesn't with this Ice Cream Maker.
For the price though, it is really good.
I messed up my first few recipes by over filling the thing.
Eventually, I was making my own delicious ice creams and sorbets.
So much fun during the summer! My kids were thrilled! ;).
We are very happy with this ice cream maker.
We have no negative comments on this machine.
Some of the recipes in the booklet (and in other recipes online or in other books) might require some additional prep work.
The ice cream maker makes 1-1/2 quarts which is more than enough for my husband and I to enjoy.
It's quick, easy and contains less preservatives than store bought.The only issue I have with it is the mixing attachment is made of plastic.
It feels like it has to be handled very gingerly or it will snap in two.
At times I am concerned that I will make an ice cream that is too thick for it to handle.
I hope this thing last a long time so we can get many uses out of it.
This ice cream maker is easy to use, easy to clean and makes delicious ice cream.
However, in my neck of the woods, sometimes it is difficult to find decent frozen yogurt that is not filled with sweetners and other additives.
I was attracted to the high end ice cream  makers, but the cost was way too prohibitive for me.
No more store bought frozen yogurt for me!! I just invested in a bunch of different Sonoma Syrups (I used Meyer Lemon for this batch).
I froze the tub in my deep freezer for 48 hours.2.
My ingredients were cold when I added them.3.
I took the tub from the freezer, turned it on and immediately added the cold ingredients.
I did not allow any time for the tub to warm up.4.
We wanted to get an Ice Cream maker so that we could make "Ice Cream" with Soy Milk for someone sensitive to dairy products.
We considered the ones with built in freezers but not only were they expensive but heavy.
We have make banana and strawberry "ice cream" using soy milk and both have come out perfect.
The total time was about 30 minutes and we ate it right out of the container without additional freezing.
We froze the leftover and it still tasked good but could not compare to the consistency of the original.
We are considering getting a second container so that we can make a second batch right after the first.
I BOUGHT THIS TO HELP ME MAKE DIET DESSERTS I COULD EAT ON A DIET.
WORKS WELL, NOT TOO NOISY, EASY TO CLEAN.
RECOMMEND BUYING EXTRA BOWL IF 1-1/2 QUARTS NOT ENOUGH, OTHERWISE HAVE TO WAIT 24 HOURS FOR BOWL TO RE-FREEZE.
This is the second one of these I've owned.
My first one is 3000 moles away at my parents house so I figured it would be cheaper to just buy another.
This makes good sorbets and ice creams (though depends on your own recipes to make them good, right?).
The freezer part is wonderful and will keep a freeze for a good hour or so.
Very simple design that is easy to clean.
This is the first ice cream maker I have purchased, and this seems to have been a good choice.
So far I have made dark chocolate gelato that came out fantastic, and some strawberry frozen yogurt.
After 25-30 minutes in the machine, the consistency and texture are quite good...definitely hard enough to eat immediately.
After having lived in Italy for a year, I really missed creamy Italian gelato, and so now I have my own way to make it.
And it's also nice because I know exactly what goes into every batch.
This machine is pretty loud, but nothing too unbearable.
I would recommend it for anyone interested in a small, easy to clean, easy to use, ice cream maker.
I have made sorbets and various full and low fat ice creams.
It is easy to use if you follow the directions and easy to clean.
It makes a product that is frozen but not hard.
We store the frozen bowl in the freezer with the bottom side down, it seems to get things a little firmer this way.
Clean-up is a breeze as there are only three parts to clean.
I just go to the market, see what looks freshest , and it's sorbet within a few hours.
Ice creams almost as easy and much better than Steve's, Baskin Robbins, etc.
I can't say enough about this little unit that looks like nothing.
It's sure something!  And at less than $50, it's a bargain.
I have wanted one of these for a long time but the price was too high.
Costco finally started carrying them for around $30, so I decided I wasn't out much if I didn't like it.Works great.
I love homemade ice cream but it is such a pain to make, especially since I am single.
The ice cream freezes great if you use an airtight bowl and still tastes freshly made.
Stays pretty soft as well, almost like having tasty soft serve ice cream.
They call for whole milk and heavy cream.
Atkins &quot;diet&quot; ice cream (egg custard sweetened with artificial sweetner) and was surprised how well it worked.
The ice cream custard was cooled to room temp and I used a dairy thermometer to measure the temperature.
Chilling the custard would have resulted in an even firmer mass, but I was impatient.
Ok, I am one who will pour through hundreds of reviews before making a purchase.
Did I mention I ADORE ice cream??I finally bought this machine.
My husband thought I was crazy and that I'd never use it.
I used half and half instead of heavy cream and it was still delightful.I am on Amazon today to buy an extra freezer container.
I do think that is a bit pricey and am considering the whole reconditioned unit so that I can make two batches simultaneously.
It's that good.It DOES come out soupy when initially made.
It's yummy that way-I dare you to not put a spoon in the top as it's whirring around, especially the first batch.
My daughter bought this item for me and I have used it so much.
It is so easy to use  and it makes delicious ice cream.
I will not rehash what everyone else has said, but this ice cream maker is everything I could ask for.
It makes ice cream and other frozen treats super fast, is easy to clean, compact, and not too loud.
Sure, it's not whisper quiet, but I didn't think the noise level was unbearable and conversation is easy to hear over it.
Cuisinart appliances have always seemed to be reliable so let's hope this one is no exception.
I already had one and liked it very very much.
It is easy to use and the product is great.
The red choice made it an even more fun gift.
Keep them clean and wrapped in the freezer.
Highly recommended! I LOVE this ice cream maker.
It's so easy and the results are amazing.
I like GOOD ice cream (like Haagen-Dazs)and this machine creates stellar ice cream.
It rivals any of the best ice cream you can find.
Even the basic recipes produce excellent ice cream.
I've made mint chip, premium vanilla bean and strawberry.
I do recommend using quality dairy products for best results (I use Organic Valley milk and heavy cream).
I won't be buying any more ice cream from you!.
This is such a great little ice cream maker.
I've used it countless times since I got it for Christmas two years ago.
Many of the highest rated ones had eggs as an ingredient.
Now we were getting somewhere - eggs add a lot of flavor if you do it right.
So, I made up my own recipe for my first batch of chocolate ice cream.
Oh! My! Gosh!  I have never, ever, ever, had ice cream that tasted so good.
My husband actually complained that he could only eat a small bowl because it was so rich.
By rich, I mean a deep chocolately flavor - sweet, but not too sweet.
My next recipe I tried (and made up) was Butter Pecan.
My husband loves it - because he can eat more of it (it's not rich at all).
Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.
Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.
Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.
Put 3 eggs* in a bowl, blend with a fork, then slowly add some of the hot cream mixture to the eggs.
Stir, add a little more, stir - all in all, you want to blend in at least half of the cream mixture.
Then pour it all back in the pot, and slowly increase heat until it just starts to bubble.
Remove from heat, add vanilla, stir.In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt butter and add pecans.
Salt the pecans and stir constantly for several minutes to "roast" the nuts.
I'm also not concerned about salmonella from these.
I don't separate the eggs, and if you do it right, there's no need.
Very easy to use and clean and good basic recipes included in the appliance's booklet.
If you want a lighter ice cream that doesn't have such a fatty aftertaste, however, try 1/2 & 1/2 instead of heavy cream.
I wish Cuisinart would include some vegan options using almond and coconut milk, too.
Just had our first batch of ice cream from this product.
Easy to use, great end results and fun.
My husband couldn't tell the difference between this ice cream and the store bought kinds.
I would highly recommend this to anyone for ease of use and cleanup.
This is a very simple machine that does what it's supposed to with very little fuss.
I put the frozen bowl part in our upright freezer at least a few hours before I expect to make ice cream.
I make the custard for the ice cream at the same time.
After dinner, I put the frozen part on the stand, put in the mixing blade and top with the lid.
Then I pour the custard in and 20-30 minutes later we enjoy fresh ice cream with no additives.
If you want ice cream that is harder than soft serve, it will need to "ripen" a bit more in your freezer.
But this is a delightful machine that I highly recommend.
I never made ice cream before it, and never want to buy it from a grocery again.
This product is getting great reviews for good reason.
Here are a few tips I've discovered along the way.
Second, chill your ingredients in the freezer for 20 minutes or so to ensure they are thoroughly chilled.
In not doing these things, I've found that I create milkshakes, and that ain't bad! It's just not always what one wants.
To get good quality ice cream with little hassle is a real treat! My only disappointment? That sorbet isn't low calorie.
Sugar substitutes could help reduce calories significantly, and I'll experiment with those recipes.
The fruit of this labor has been enjoyed by family and friends who are so glad I went into sharing ice cream.
This is an excellent little machine that makes just enough icecream for my family and I know exactly what goes in it.
The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the manual states the bowl will be ready between 6 and 22 hours.
I tried using it after 6 and 12 hours.
At 6 hours it did not do anything with the blended mixture.
At 12 hours, I got the outside of the mixture sticking to the bowl and the core of the mixture not churned/frozen.
It also makes GOOD ice cream - I haven't had a complaint yet! Highly recommend!.
When first made, the ice cream is about the consistency of soft serve or a Wendy's Frosty.
That's just fine with me, the flavor is best this way.
After freezing whatever is left of the batch, the consistency is like store bought ice cream.
I do not do anything fancy with it, just follow the directions in the included booklet for basic vanilla ice cream.
Otherwise the ice cream will be real runny.
I try to freeze it for 24 hours before use.
As long as the directions are followed on this machine, it makes great ice cream every time.
This is by far my most used kitchen gadget.
Love it! Am going to buy another one as a gift right now.
I actually have the red model with 2 freezer inserts.
It's a very simple machine with only 4 parts and is easy to clean.
I put my finished ice cream in containers in the freezer and they're ready to eat in a couple of hours.
I saw some people complained of the noise, but it's not all that loud and it only churns for 30 minutes.
Here's the link to my ice cream recipe (makes 2 inserts worth of ice cream) if you're interested.
[...]  I am very happy with this purchase.
It works best if you make sure that the bowl is 100% frozen solid, which means leaving it in the freezer at least overnight.
Also once you've made your mix, put that in the freezer too for a little while so it's very cold.
I bought this ice cream maker after I took an Ice Cream, Gelato and Sorbet class at Sur La Table cooking store.
Because we were making so many different types of desserts, we had several ice cream makers working in the classroom at the same time.
The bowl froze easily (probably in less than 24 hours) in the bottom and back of the freezer.
I originally thought I'd seldom use it, but it's very easy to use and turns out great tasting results!I have no complaints.
The recipe book included with the unit has great basic ideas (I especially enjoy the Coffee Ice Cream, I add toffee to mine).
From there, the possibilities are endless!If you can measure, you can make ice cream.
The noise reminds me to keep checking my ice cream to see if it's "done".
great price, good ice cream, you can't go wrong with this!.
I've made vanilla, strawberry (using fresh strawberries) and chocolate ice cream in this machine and it was all yummy.
I just used the recipes that came with the machine.
Each batch consistently took 25 minutes to make.
It's easy to use and easy to clean.
I bought the red unit which adds a fun color to my kitchen when not in use.
The opening at the top is also convenient for scooping up a spoonful of ice cream for tasting without turning the unit off.
I love how simple and easy it is to use.
But I just make a batch early before dinner and store it in the freezer while we're eating.
I bought this machine for my husband following the recommendations here.
Consequently I also bought him the extra freezing container and two books of recipes,one being the Ben and Jerry's book.
So far he has produced several excellent batches of ice cream.
We are delighted and impressed! It's so easy and so much fun!.
Lets start by saying I hate gadjets, took me years to buy a food processor.
But my sister is on chemo, and I found out she dislikes the taste of commercial ice cream, even the expensive stuff.
They both get a lot of use and get high marks all around!.
This is our 2nd Cuisinart ice cream maker.
This is just as easy as running to the store and buying a carton of additive-packed ice cream.
Freeze the bowl, mix your ingredients, fire it up, add your mixture, blend-blend-blend, ice cream.
The owner's manual comes with many recipes and with sites like Pinterest I have discovered many more.
One of my favorites is 1 cup frozen pink lemonade concentrate, 3 cups milk, and 3 tbsp Splenda for a tangy frozen treat.
A tip: do not use a metal sppon to scrape the bowl, it will leave unsightly scratch marks.
Hopefully I did not ruin my bowl by doing that.
If you want to wow your dinner guests, whip up a batch of the strawberry sorbet.
I purchased this item from another online retailer and bought it refurbished.
It works terrific and I'm very pleased with my purchase.
I love this because you decide on the ratio of cream to milk & how much sugar/sweeterner to add.
Also, I always store mine in the freezer so it is ready to go whenever anybody wants to make ice cream.
Add extra mix-ins at the end for a variety of flavors.
We love it & there's nothing better on a hot summer night.
I bought 2 of these so I would always have one chilled and ready to go.
I really like how fast it makes ice cream.
I use both of the bowls and keep the second unit in storage as a replacement when this one wears out.
Its not that much more to buy 2 units compared with buying an extra freezer bowl.
So I should be making frozen desserts for years.I also make frozen yogurt and pudding ice cream.
The texture is just right when its finished.
I added frozen fruit at the end and it was great.It does get firmer if you put it into the freezer.
So I put it into individual portions and that way I don't have to deal with a block.Clean up is easy.
i gave it to my sister after gaining a few pounds of making delicioso ice cream for one summer.
this machine works and it is inexpensive and its awesome to be able to make ice cream in my own home.
I will get an updated model of this next summer (after i workout intensely for 3 months).
I bought this as a Christmas present to myself last year.
It was a great price, and now I can make whatever weird flavored ice cream I can think of.
I really was not expecting the quality of product I received in the Cuisinart ICE-20R Ice Cream Maker.
I was buying on the name recognition only, best price, and expected a glorified toy.
But, this little machine is not only cute.
it is EASY to use and delivers! It's truly a professional kitchen appliance that works like a charm!  In addition, it is easy to use.
25 minutes later you're eating the real deal.
From chocolate candy cane, to cinnamon apple crumble, to avocado (yes!) - this ice cream maker helped my vegan ice cream dreams come true.
With better side-scrapers or some kind of middle-freeze-chamber - it could be better.
Why  you might ask ??  I had difficulty not boiling the custard and also determining if it was thick enough to remove from the heat.
All of the parts washed up nicely and went together quickly.
I ran it while showering at 6:00 a.m.
no.I would recommend this product and purchase again.
Without a doubt, this is a great appliance!  Mine was a gift, but Amazon's price is the best (as is the service).
It works exactly as Cuisinart says it will and what more can you ask than honesty.The bowl freezes quickly in my upright freezer.
Some reviews say their bowl never freezes solid.
Start with a proven recipe to get the feel of it, then improvise.We are healthy eaters.
It's nice to know the ingredients I'm using are healthy.
It's also nice to be able to adjust the sweetness to our liking.Have fun!.
The savings over store bought ice cream is phenomenal too.
I only have one small exception to our "eye blasting red" ice cream maker (and it is indeed a small exception).
It could be perhaps be a bit quieter.
I bought this for my elderly mother and she loves it!  It's working wonderfuly and making some fantastic ice cream.
She can see it make the ice cream from the top.
I'm sure it would be fun for kids to watch as well.
Take some chocolate milk, cool whip and eagle brand milk.
25 minutes you have ice cream that tastes like a Wendy's Frosty.
It actually tastes better after being in the frig overnight.
I was amazed how easy the ICE-20  is to clean.
No salt to rinse out, no ice - just some great, smooth, wonderful ice cream.
After ice cream is made, you just rinse the bowl with hot water, dry and return to the freezer for the next time.
The paddle and lid are also very easy to clean.
The manual says to keep the bowl in a plastic bag to prevent freezer burn.
I have had my ice cream maker for appr.
one month and I could not be happier so far.
One of the best things about homemade ice cream and ice is that they seem to encourage people to join in making them.
You see, the chemistry of freezing foods has its own set of built-in limits.
Since you'll be serving it right away, you can stop the machine whenever the mixture looks right.
I have purchased this ice-cream maker refurbished from Amazon.com and it works great.
It is very quiet (a bit louder than your average microwave) and doesn't take up much counter space.
However, it is definitely not for impulse ice-cream eaters.
The recipes are by no means plentiful but offer an idea how to make good ice-cream.
So if you like your ice-cream vey solid, you are probably better off just getting a pint of Ben & Jerry's.
I bought the red one and it looks very nice on my countertop.
I was worried it might be loud after reading a review, but it is NOT - not at all.
We made lemon sorbet and it turned out great.
The only thing is, I recommend using 1/4 cup less sugar than the recipe says, because it was quite sweet.
The sorbet was yummy and fresh, and the most delectable fresh lemon aroma drifted from the machine as it churned away.
Yesterday we made vanilla ice cream, and it was delicious.
It is so cool to watch it firm up and fun to count down the seconds at the finish.
I probably only use it about 3-4 times a year, but I could not do without it.
I just finished making Nigella Lawson's (Food TV) Margarita ice cream.
If you have any doubts about an ice cream maker, get that recipe and try it, you'll be glad you got the ice cream machine.
Again, I recommend the Ben & Jerry's ice cream recipe book to go with it!------------------------------I never knew ice cream could be so easy.
Someone at work shared his Ben & Jerry's book with me, which inspired me to get the ice cream maker.
Because of the price and fat in heavy whipping cream, I use part half and half.
And another colleague at work suggested using 1/4 cup or so of Dream Whip for smoothness.
Jury still out on that one.But it's all good.
If you don't have one yet, hurry!  Before summer gets here and you really want a delicious bowl of homemake ice cream!.
Works great...6 cups is perfect for husband and I, never been sorry for purchase.
I just received this yesterday, and after freezing the container for 6 hours we tried a batch of frozen yogurt.
I was a little apprehensive, since I'd read reviews where people were unable to get good results even after freezing the unit for 24 hours.
We've been using our old electric rock salt machine, but now we'll probably get rid of it.
Also, due to the ease of using this Cuisinart maker, we'll make more of our own ice cream more often.
The key to this maker is the cylinder which has walls filled with anti-freeze.
If you have any inclination to make your own ice cream, this is the machine to have, in my humble opinion.
The metal container portion of the ice cream maker has hollow walls that are filled with a fluid.
About a half hour to an hour later you have fresh delicious ice cream!  It's that simple.
Also, by the way, it's the best ice cream you'll ever have.
Buy this as I did and you won't be sorry.
Refrigerate your mixture after making it for at least a couple hours.
It comes out great, I have very little problem with ice crystals forming.
I do make sure to stop the freezer after 20-25 minutes of operation or the ice cream will start to soften.
And I learned early on to chill the ingredients OVERNIGHT or the ice cream won't freeze - just gets thick.
But it's a great item, and doesn't take up much space on the counter.
I'm especially happy with it since I can't eat regular ice cream because of lactose intolerance.
So I use liquid nondairy creamer to make ice cream in this freezer and it's very satisfactory!.
I am extremely pleased with my purchase of this simple but amazing unit.
No mess, quick, easy, home made ice cream.
Once you've tasted your first scoop you'll be addicted.
Great for frozen drinks, too, including alcoholic drinks like pina colada and frozen Jack 'n coke.Solid construction, powerful motor.
The best and fastest way to make excellent ice cream and sorbet.
Wonderful product!!!!!!!!!Cuisinart ICE-20 Automatic 1-1/2-Quart Ice-Cream Maker, White.
You simple mix-up the ingredients, chill, and then pour into the  pre-frozen bowl.
I highly recommend the book,  &quot;Gelato! : Italian Ice Cream, Sorbetti &amp; Granite&quot; by Pamela  Sheldon Johns as a great add-on.
I ordered the book with the hope of being  able to duplicate the Stracciatella(?) Gelato I had while on vacation in  Italy.
The recipe was simple (heavy cream, milk, sugar, vanilla, and  shaved chocolate) and the results were fabulous.This machine would  make a great gift as well!.
The batch is enough for a family, well assuming everybody get a regular size cup.
You have to freeze the container for a day, but it is an unexpensive machine compare to those freezer units which cost a lot more.
I bought mine at bed, bath & beyond for $ 40.00.
I would buy this product again & again.
I picked this up at the start of summer.
i've made quite a few batches of ice cream.
My favorites come from the Ben & Jerry cook book.
There are a lot of benefits from making your own ice cream.
Shake it and if anything sloshes, it's not ready.#2 Chill all ingredients.
Even if the ingredients just came from the fridge, put the batter back in.
I test my batter to make sure it's 35-38 degrees before starting.
This will make the freezing process more gradual, which means the ice crystals will be smaller.
Small crystals mean a smoother texture.#3 I let the machine work until there's little or no movement in the ice cream.
This depends on how much you've got in the machine, but my recipes make the ice cream expand up above the lip of the container.
IT WILL BE SOFT, maybe even runny, out of the machine.
I try to avoid runny, so next time either let the machine run longer or your kitchen may be too warm.
Also resist the urge to pack the ice cream down, with either a utensil or by dropping it on the counter.
A smooth surface may look nice, but you want to keep air in the ice cream.
The air is what makes it easy to scoop and gives it a good texture.#5 Put the bowl in a plastic bag while in freezer.
This keep the frost out and improves taste.
Make sure it's completely dry before going back in the freezer.#6 I'd also recommend going all out and using rich cream batters.
These have the least water and will have the best texture.
I'd prefer one scoop of really good ice cream to 4 of a crappy sorbet.#7 Add solid stuff near the end.
Wait until the last 1/2 of freezing to add your berries, chips, etc.
This will help to evenly distribute stuff throughout the mixture.
They fit perfectly and allow the least amount of freezer air to touch the ice cream.
Fat easily obsorbs oders and can make your ice cream taste funky.
You could just keep it in the bowl, but I wouldn't do that unless you plan to eat it all later that day.
I also know of some machines that have a reverse function.
Haven't bought ice cream from the store since.
In a cooking class, I shared a table with a lady who regaled me with all the different flavors of ice cream she experimented with.
That idea appealed to me so that I went straight to Amazon and bought my first ice cream maker.
Just two days ago, my Cuisanart Ice Cream Maker (1 1/2 quart) arrived and the freezer bowl went straight into the freezer.
This ice cream maker is very easy to use and comes with very clear instructions.
I discovered that you must follow the instructions exactly.
If that sequence is not followed the lid won't fit properly.
I have make five pint batches of ice cream in seven days and couldn't be happier with this maker.
This was a good purchase and the recipe book is great! I've made half of them now; some were awesome, some good, some didn't work.
The only negative was that it was pretty loud and it got hot around the base after 10 minutes or so, which I found strange.
An ice cream maker shouldn't get hot! The ice cream is still really yummy, but the machine could use a few mechanical tweeks.
Overall, for $60, it does the job and there haven't been any major problems!.
I purchased this ice cream maker so that my husband and I can enjoy low or no carb ice cream.
It makes the best ice cream, easy clean up.
After that first fiasco, my homemade ice cream has been yummy!.
Use your favorite soda to make great slushies.
My kids love it!!!!You could even use Lemonade flavored with sugar or for adults frozen Marguarita's.
This machine makes ice-cream making SO much fun.
A little noisy, but similar to most ice cream machines...except makes fresh ice cream in 20-30 minutes!.
We run the ice cream maker for 30 min.
It makes a nice soft serve ice cream, if you want it firmer put it in a container the freezer.
I was impressed with the sale price, so I bought this on a whim.
An ice cream maker rookie, I was rather skeptical by the ease-of-use claims.
That's it.Notes:- The instruction book contains a few basic recipies, including vanilla ice cream and sherbet, to get you started.
This is helpful if you want to make a batch right away.- Watch the proportions in the recipies, as they are not exact.
You may want to taste your mixture before putting it into the machine.
As such, small children (with your supervision) can use this to try out their cooking skills.Enjoy!.
As soon as it arrived, I cleaned the bucket and put it in the freezer, and checked the parts.
Sure, it's a bit plasticky, but that's okay with me.
Then found a recipe for sorbet, made the base and put it in the fridge.
That's why I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet the unit is.
I talked to my son on my cell phone right next to it while it was running, and I had no problem hearing him.
When I was finished, my mixture had the texture of a thick milkshake, so I popped it in the freezer and it hardened right up.
After 20 minutes, the bucket was still very cold even though it was over 80 in the house.So far, so good.
I'm very happy with my ice cream maker, and look forward to a summer of icy treats :).
I ordered this RED ice cream maker to give to my husband's daughter and family for Christmas along with a RED quesadilla maker.
I keep the bowl in the freezer in a plastic bag as recommended so it's ready when we are.
It's the perfect size for my husband and me.
Have used the basic vanilla receipe in the instruction book with excellent results.
IT's SO EASY! I like that the top is open so I can add things, like fresh strawberries to the batch as it freezes.
I'm sending my daughter one for a gift.
We might use our old salt and ice freezer for a planter or something.
Hard to stay on a diet with this on the counter.
Lots of great recipes and the ice cream and sorbet are yummy!.
I did tons of online research and hands down, THIS machine got top ratings no matter what site I visited.
Some places offer a 2nd bowl for an additional price but I knew I wouldn't need that much ice cream.
Try using a high quality buttermilk for 1 cup of the liquid; it's low calorie and adds a nice twang to the end result.
Yes, upfront I'll say it's a little noisy, but that kind of goes with the territory.
Works perfectly, just as described in the directions.
I keep the bowl in the freezer all the time now.
It doesn't take up as much room as I feared it would.
Makes great ice cream, ice milk, bases for margaritas and sorbets and of course frozen yogurt.
I highly recommend going to the trouble of making a custard based ice cream.
Once you do that you may never make it any other way.
I have tried 4 different recipes in this machine so far.
3 were from the manual that came with the machine, and one was from the internet.
All 3 from the manual did not have very good texture.
The ice cream was not creamy and melty, it was either icy or fudgy.
I like the machine, it is easy to use, but also quite loud.
We ended up moving it in to the bathroom while it churned.
The recipe we tried that we got online was most like regular ice cream, but I didn't like that it had uncooked eggs in it.
I have wanted one of these machines for two years.
I finally got a great deal on it at Amazon, and snapped it up.
It says that you can freeze it for 6-22 hours, or until you shake the bowl and can't hear any liquid sloshing around.
So, I froze the bowl for 6 hours and sure enough, no sloshing.
But, this is simply not enough! My strawberry ice cream tasted wonderful, but in the machine never made it past a thick liquid stage.
I had to put it in the freezer for hours to get it hard enough to eat.
I've had one for a few weeks now, and many of the positive points of this unit have been mentioned in other reviews.
The &quot;premium chocolate&quot; is like eating a frozen truffle.
we enjoyed it, but it might be too bittersweet for kids.
The sherbets are under-flavored, and the frozen yogurt is extremely yogurty and unlike what you buy commercially.
Fortunately, you don't have to use their recipe.
I highly recommend Alton Brown's &quot;burned peach&quot; ice cream.
a quick google should find it at food.com.
After several failed attempts, I began to wonder if I would ever be able to make creamy dreamy ice cream at home.
Finally, I ordered the right one!  This ice cream maker really does work.
The only time it will not work is if your freezer is not set to the coldest setting.
I also found the extra freezer bowl to be indispensable.
This drastically speeds up the process.I also use the freezer bowl for other items I want to cool down quickly.
I use it to cool down Jello when making a Raspberry Mousse.
I have been known to place the whole contraption right into the freezer.
I also disobey the instructions and let the ice cream freeze until solid in the ice cream freezer bowl.
I found it just works faster that way.
That way your ice cream is ready in 40 minutes!  Yes, it takes 20-30 minutes and then 10 more minutes in the freezer.
At least that is how it goes in my kitchen.
If you start the ice cream before dinner, you won't even notice the time.Here is a favorite recipe for a slushy.
Heat honey in the microwave and stir into juice.2.
Pour in juice, freeze 10 minutes or until slushy.
Serve in tall glasses with straws.Makes 4 glasses~The Rebecca Review.
My bowl was super cold (overnight, lowest freezer setting) and it got to the "soft serve" stage fairly quickly.
My mistake was that I left it going too long, hoping it would get firmer.
We've had a lot of fun and good eating from this machine.
With a little tweaking of the recipes it turns out a really nice product.The ice cream produced is best if eaten fresh.
After it has been in the freezer it becomes a bit too crystalline for my taste.
This may mean cutting recipes in half but still works fine.
This is a very good model for making sorbets and ice cream.
It costs more to make ice cream at home than if you buy Hagan-Daaz in the store.
But, if you really like to make your own concoction, than this is really great.
Also, the insert will take up some room in your freezer and takes time to ice up.
then it started not working and i realized because it is not forgiving.
you must make sure the custard mixture is thick enough and that it is cooled properly and that the freezer bowl is properly frozen.
it makes great ice cream when you follow the instructions carefully.
Makes ice cream! I am on a no carb diet.
but I didn't want to give up my favorite frozen treat.
the ice cream holder itself requires about 24hrs to freeze prior to use.
You can of course use it before 24 hours.
which is also fine  :)I have never used an ice cream maker before this one.
he said this one is A LOT quieter.I love it.
We were somewhat skeptical about how the machine would work but were pleasantly surprised.
It is simple to use, with complete instructions and recipes.
And it makes wonderful ice cream in minutes.
Will never buy ice cream again!!  At first was hesitant bytthe few negative reviews.
So far they have all turned out GREAT!  have always loved soft serve better.
But, i did make sure all the ingredients were real cold before i put them into the machine.
and also i put the 2 bowls into the chest freezer in plastic bags.
